data classification:


Aqv_crawler.py -> output raw data of air quality data in each state

trends_by_day.py ->output raw data of trends score of each keywords of  each state everyday since 1/20 to 4/21

AQV_combine_three_air_data.py ->join region in to state with timestamp and air quality value

AQV_avg.py ->output average value of each region in each state

Data_classification.py -> join all raw data into a dataframe
 
classify_data_level.py -> output level of each data in each factors and WOE of each level of each factor

Factor_IV.py ->output IV value of each factors

predict.py -> output coeffiecient and interception of SVM and logistic regression 

raw_square_cube.py -> output coeffiecient and interception of SVM and logistic regression  from data join with cube(data) and square(data)

pytorch.py -> different training model we didn't use at last
.
